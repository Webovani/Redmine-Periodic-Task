In some projects there are tasks that need to be assigned on a schedule.
Such as check the ssl registration once per year
or
run security checks every 3 months

This is the redmine plugin for you if you need such a thing.
just install it, then make sure you add this to ccron to run once per day

0 1 * * * cd /var/www/<redminedir>; rake redmine:periodic_tasks RAILS_ENV="production"

on each project it will add a new tab named Scheduled Tasks just go there to add your task

(note: this initial version is a bit rough around the edges, hopefully i will get to clean some stuff up later or maybe someone else will do it)

make sure you run rake db:migrate_plugins as specified for installing new plugins
